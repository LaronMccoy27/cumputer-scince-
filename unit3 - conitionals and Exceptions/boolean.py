# boolean Expressions 
# kinda like a mathmatical formula
# 14 + 10 = 24    algebra uses arithmetic operators 
# + - / * ** % //
# can only evaluate to true or fale 
# 5 > 10 = false   bolean algebra uses compariosn operators 
# > < >= <= == !=

print(14 + 10)  # algebra 
print(5 > 10)   # boolean algebra

x = 5           # Set x epual to 5, tell it what to be 
print(5 == 5)     #get x epual 5,ask a question

# this is the perfect test question 
# what is the difference between = and == ?

print(4 >= 2)       #true
print(1993 == 1993)   #true
print(-90 < -99)   #false  
print(10 != 10)    #false
